# Convex Hull
This is an implementation of a convex hull algorithm used in CS 312 at Brigham Young University.

Wikipedia defines a convex hull as
>>> In geometry, the convex hull, convex envelope or convex closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it.
Along with this definition, this implementation finds the smallest convex closure around a set of randomly generated points. To pass the assignment, the algorithm had to finish within a certain time limit.
